</title>
  <h1>
     My journey
  </h1>
  <P>
    This is my first website
    <b>
       I AM REALLY EXCITED.
    </b> 
    just want to tell you guys and people that are learning to code tht it's
     <U>
       a piece of cake.
    </U>
    Now a lot of you may be thinking where do i start should i start from scratch, python looks nice, oh java, the 
    thing is that you don't have to have to be good in information technology or robotics.
    I was just like most of you just inquisitive and willing to learn and you don't have to go to coding academy
    or some tecnhologicalized university you can start learning within the four corners of your own house 
    that's how i started. 
    <P>
      Now i am not saying all this to waste your time i rather saying this as to inspire you
      to <b> STOP PROCASTINATING , IT'S NOW OR NEVER START NOW, </b> you can just go online and search 
      for courses they even offer free courses even those of you looking for job's this might just be 
      your passage way to success and happiness 
    </P>

    you can do it just start today , start now you can do it and when your done i know you will be happy
    it may take days or weeks even months to master how to code but at the end you will be
    rejoicing i made this website so as for others to experience the joy this website is just 
    an introduction i will be making more better one's in the future so see you around.
